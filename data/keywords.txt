1. *News categories:* These keywords represent the broad classification of news stories, such as politics, business, technology, entertainment, sports, and health.

2. *Geographical locations:* Keywords that indicate the geographic focus or origin of the news story, such as countries, cities, regions, or continents (e.g., United States, New York, Europe, Africa).

3. *People:* Keywords related to individuals, including their names, titles, or roles, who are involved in or relevant to the news story (e.g., Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Angela Merkel).

4. *Organizations:* Keywords that represent public and private organizations, companies, and institutions associated with the news story (e.g., United Nations, Google, World Health Organization).

5. *Events:* Keywords that denote specific events or happenings covered by the news story, such as elections, natural disasters, protests, or conferences (e.g., Olympics, Presidential Election, Hurricane Ida).

6. *Issues:* Keywords that highlight the key issues, topics, or themes discussed in the news story, such as climate change, immigration, income inequality, or cybersecurity.
